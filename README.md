## 🎯 Project Overview

This project implements a state-of-the-art text steganography system using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to hide text messages within images. Unlike traditional LSB methods, our GAN-based approach provides superior security and resistance to steganalysis attacks.

### ✨ Key Achievements
- **88.3% Character Accuracy** - Excellent text extraction fidelity
- **23.1 Hour Training** - Efficient compared to image-to-image approaches
- **Production Ready** - Complete evaluation and testing framework
- **Security Focused** - Superior to traditional LSB steganography

- GAN-based adversarial training
- Multi-objective loss (reconstruction + adversarial + text recovery)
- CIFAR-10 dataset (50,000 32x32 RGB images)
- Diverse text corpus (passwords, URLs, coordinates, API keys)

### Usage Example
```python
# Load trained model components
from src.text_gan_architecture import TextSteganoGenerator, TextExtractor, TextEmbedding
from src.text_processor import TextProcessor

# Initialize components
text_processor = TextProcessor(max_length=128)
generator = TextSteganoGenerator(text_embed_dim=128)
extractor = TextExtractor(vocab_size=95, max_length=128)

# Hide text in image
text = "password123"
text_tensor = text_processor.encode_text(text)
stego_image = generator(cover_image, text_embedding)

# Extract text from image
extracted_logits = extractor(stego_image)
extracted_text = text_processor.decode_text(extracted_logits)
print(f"Original: {text}")
print(f"Extracted: {extracted_text}")  # ~88.3% accuracy
```

## 📱 Applications

### Security Use Cases
- **Password Protection** - Hide login credentials in profile pictures
- **URL Concealment** - Share secret links through innocent images
- **API Key Hiding** - Protect authentication tokens in documentation
- **Financial Data** - Secure transaction details and account numbers
- **Location Privacy** - Hide GPS coordinates and addresses
- **Emergency Contacts** - Conceal important contact information

### Example Scenarios
```python
# Hide different types of sensitive data
test_cases = [
    "password123",                              # Login credentials
    "https://secret-site.com/api/v1/data",     # Secret URLs
    "GPS: 40.7128, -74.0060",                 # Location data
    "API_KEY=sk-1234567890abcdef",             # API credentials
    "Transfer $5000 to account 987654321",     # Financial data
    "Emergency: +1-555-0123",                 # Contact info
]
# Each achieves ~88% character extraction accuracy
```

## 🔒 Security Analysis

### GAN vs LSB Comparison
| Method | Accuracy | Image Quality | Security | Detection Resistance |
|--------|----------|---------------|----------|---------------------|
| **GAN (Ours)** | 88.3% | 11.92 dB | High | Excellent |
| **LSB Traditional** | ~95% | ~48 dB | Low | Poor |

### Security Advantages
- **Learned Embedding Strategy** - No predictable patterns
- **Steganalysis Resistance** - Harder to detect than LSB
- **Adaptive Approach** - Adjusts to cover image characteristics
- **No Statistical Signatures** - Avoids obvious pixel modifications
