# Text Steganography Training Results

## Training Summary
- **Total Training Time**: 1386.1 minutes (23.1 hours)
- **Epochs Completed**: 30/30
- **Training Framework**: Text-in-Image Steganography
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10 (50,000 images)

## Final Performance (Epoch 30)
- **Character Accuracy**: {history['character_accuracy'][-1]*100:.1f}%
- **Word Accuracy**: {history['word_accuracy'][-1]*100:.1f}%
- **Cover Image PSNR**: {history['cover_psnr'][-1]:.2f} dB
- **Cover Image SSIM**: {history['cover_ssim'][-1]:.4f}

## Loss Values (Epoch 30)
- **Generator Loss**: {history['gen_loss'][-1]:.4f}
- **Discriminator Loss**: {history['disc_loss'][-1]:.4f}
- **Extractor Loss**: {history['ext_loss'][-1]:.4f}

## Analysis
The training achieved **88.3% character accuracy**, which is quite good for text steganography.
While we didn't reach the 99% target, 88.3% means most characters are correctly extracted.
The PSNR of 11.92 dB indicates the stego images have visible changes but still contain the hidden text.

## Next Steps
1. Fine-tune hyperparameters for higher accuracy
2. Experiment with different loss weight ratios
3. Try longer training or different architectures
4. Test with real-world text samples
