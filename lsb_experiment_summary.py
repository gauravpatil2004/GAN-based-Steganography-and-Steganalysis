LSB STEGANOGRAPHY BIT ALLOCATION EXPERIMENT - RESULTS SUMMARY

🎯 EXPERIMENT GOAL:
Understand the trade-off between hiding capacity and image quality in LSB steganography.

📊 TESTED CONFIGURATIONS:
- 1-bit LSB: 12.5% capacity
- 2-bit LSB: 25.0% capacity  
- 3-bit LSB: 37.5% capacity
- 4-bit LSB: 50.0% capacity
- 5-bit LSB: 62.5% capacity
- 6-bit LSB: 75.0% capacity
- 7-bit LSB: 87.5% capacity
- 8-bit LSB: 100.0% capacity

🔍 KEY FINDINGS:

1. QUALITY vs CAPACITY TRADE-OFF:
   • More bits = Higher capacity but Lower quality
   • 1-2 bits: Excellent quality (>30 dB PSNR)
   • 3-4 bits: Good quality (25-30 dB PSNR)
   • 5+ bits: Noticeable degradation (<25 dB PSNR)

2. OPTIMAL CONFIGURATIONS:
   • High Quality: 1-2 bit LSB (minimal visual changes)
   • Balanced: 3-4 bit LSB (good quality + reasonable capacity)
   • High Capacity: 6-8 bit LSB (maximum data hiding)

3. PRACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:
   • For undetectable hiding: Use 1-2 bits
   • For general steganography: Use 4 bits (50% capacity)
   • For maximum payload: Use 6-8 bits (accept quality loss)

📈 TYPICAL RESULTS (CIFAR-10 32x32 images):
Bits | Capacity | Cover PSNR | Secret PSNR | Use Case
-----|----------|------------|-------------|----------
1    | 12.5%    | ~35 dB     | ~15 dB      | Covert communication
2    | 25.0%    | ~32 dB     | ~18 dB      | Secure messaging  
4    | 50.0%    | ~26 dB     | ~22 dB      | Balanced approach
6    | 75.0%    | ~22 dB     | ~24 dB      | High capacity
8    | 100.0%   | ~18 dB     | ~26 dB      | Maximum payload

💡 INSIGHTS FOR GAN-BASED STEGANOGRAPHY:
1. Traditional LSB has clear limitations in quality
2. Need for smarter embedding strategies 
3. GANs can potentially overcome the capacity-quality trade-off
4. Target: Achieve >30 dB PSNR with >50% capacity

🚀 NEXT STEPS (Day 4: GAN Architecture Design):
1. Design Generator network for steganography
2. Design Discriminator for steganalysis detection
3. Implement loss functions for quality and security
4. Compare GAN results with LSB benchmarks

✅ EXPERIMENT STATUS: COMPLETED
📁 Generated artifacts:
   - LSB encoding/decoding functions with variable bits
   - Quality analysis framework
   - Trade-off understanding
   - Baseline for GAN comparison

🎉 Ready to move to GAN-based steganography implementation!
